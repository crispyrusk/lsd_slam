# LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM

LSD-SLAM is a novel approach to real-time monocular SLAM. It is fully direct (i.e. does not use keypoints / features) and creates large-scale, 
semi-dense maps in real-time on a laptop. For more information see
[http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam)
where you can also find the corresponding publications and Youtube videos, as well as some 
example-input datasets, and the generated output as rosbag or .ply point cloud.

This fork contains a version that relieves the user of the horrors of a ROS dependency and uses the much nicer lightweight [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) framework instead.

# 1. Quickstart / Minimal Setup

Requires OpenCV (with nonfree if you want FABMAP), Boost, Eigen, Pangolin and g2o. Tested on 16.04 without any problems.

# 2. Installation

Install everything from apt repos if you can, otherwise there are githubs for Pangolin and g2o. Then usual cmake building process.

# 3. Running

Supports raw PNG images. For example, you can down any dataset from [here](http://vision.in.tum.de/lsdslam) in PNG format, and run like;

./LSD -c ~/Mono_Logs/LSD_machine/cameraCalibration.cfg -f ~/Mono_Logs/LSD_machine/images/
